                        <h3>THE 1987 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES – ARTICLE III</h3>
                        <p>Article III of the Philippine Constitution is the Bill of Rights. It establishes the relationship of the individual to the State and defines the rights of the individual by limiting the lawful powers of the State. It is one of the most important political achievements of the Filipinos.

                            The concept of a Bill of Rights, as such, is essentially an occidental prod-uct. For a number of centuries in British, French, and American political thought, there has grown the conviction that the rights of the individual must be preserved and safeguarded, not through the authority of an individual, not through membership in a particular group or party, not through reliance upon force of arms, but rather through the accepted processes of declared constitutional law.</p>

                                <h3>Government Power vs. Individual Freedom</h3>
                                <p>1. Among the changes brought about by the Period of Enlightenment was the shift of power from the crown to the individual. The long reign of monarchs came to an end, and the rule of the people became the standard. The government, while still the repository of power, was limited to its role as the protector of the people and the guardian of rights. Liberalism, which took its cue from individualism, advocated the principle of egalitarianism, in which men, regardless of their status in life, are regarded as equals in terms of rights before the law. Modern democracies are founded on these liberal ideals, in that the heart of democratic objectives is the protection of human dignity and respect for human rights.</p>
                                <p>2. Nonetheless, the government remains to be a powerful institution, capable of summoning the military, evoking its past image as the uncontestable holder of sovereignty. In fact, republicanism essentially requires delegation of powers to the government; that although the people remain to be the sovereign, actual exercise of it is given to the government. Protection and service of the people is the primal duty of the government, but be that as it may, the government is still the single biggest institution that exercises sovereign powers.</p>
                                <p>3. More so, it possesses the “inherent powers” which the Constitution itself does not confer. Every government for it to exist exercises “police power,” “power of eminent domain,” and “power of taxation.” A constitution does not grant such powers to the government; a constitution can only define and delimit them and allocate their exercise among various government agencies.[1] These are awesome powers, which, if left uncheck, may seriously restrict and jeopardize the freedom of individuals. Thus, it is inbuilt in every democratic constitution to meticulously include provisions guaranteeing the rights of the individuals and those restricting the powers of the government. This is to prevent the tragedy that the government created by the people will in turn be the instrument to enslave and abuse them.</p>
                                <p>4. The Bill of Rights (Article III) is an indispensable part of the Constitution. In fact, it is one of the most important parts of the fundamental law since it aims at balancing the power of the government and the various freedoms of the individual. As will be seen below, the Bill of Rights provide for two things: first, restrictions directed against the state, and, second, explicit identification and limitation of rights of the individuals. On the one hand, the government exercises its tremendous powers, but its powers are limited by the Constitution. On the other hand, the individuals are guaranteed of their rights, but subject also to limitations in recognition of the powers of the government. What balances the two (power and freedom) are the limitations provided by the Constitution, which limitations are by nature compromises or solutions to situations resulting from the overlapping or conflict of the two realms. For example, while the government has the inherent authority to take and convert a property for public use, and the people on the other have the right to hold their private property, the Constitution, contemplating a case of overlap or conflict between the two, compromises both by prescribing that the government gives just compensation to the private owner who in turn must surrender his property.</p>

                        <p class="testimonial-text"><strong>Meaning of the Bill of Rights</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p class="testimonial-text">1. From the foregoing, it is not difficult to understand that the Bill of Rights refers to the declaration and enumeration of the fundamental civil and political rights of a person with the primary purpose of safeguarding the person from violations by the government, as well as by individuals and group of individuals. It includes the protection of the following rights:</p>
                        <p class="testimonial-text">(a) Civil rights or those rights belonging to individuals by virtue of their citizenship, such as freedom to contract, right to property, and marriage among others;</p>
                        <p class="testimonial-text">(b) Political rights which are rights pertaining to the citizenship of the individual vis-à-vis the administration of the government, such as right of suffrage right to hold office, and right to petition for redress of wrong;</p>
                        <p class="testimonial-text">(c) Socio-economic rights or those which ensure the well-being and economic security of an individual; and</p>
                        <p class="testimonial-text">(d) Rights of the accused which refer to protections given to the person of an accused in any criminal case.</p>
                        <p class="testimonial-text">2. It must be noted that the restriction provided in the Bill of Rights is directed against the government, so that it does not govern private relations. As far as the Constitution is concerned, Article III can be invoked only against the government. Nonetheless, with the inclusion of almost all the constitutional rights in Article 32 of the Civil Code, the same may now be invoked in civil cases involving relations between private persons. Thus, the definition above indicates that the bill of rights is a safeguard not just against the abuses of the government but also of individuals or group of individuals.</p>
